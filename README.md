Our program uses binary term weights (1 - term in document, 0 - term is not in the document) and cosine similarity to compute the top ten best matching documents for each query in a query file. We used the sqrt function from the Python Standard Library "math" to aid in our cosine similarity calculation. 

The submission includes all the necessary files to run the program. The parsing.py file from Assignment 1 generatees necessary dictionaries, read_index.py contains functions that aid in the ranking and outputting process, and VSM.py contains our main function that takes user inputs and outputs the results file.

The file generated by running our program with the queries in 'query_file.txt' and the documents contained in the folder 'ap89_collection_small.zip' is included in the submission (output_file.txt). 

To run, include two command line arguments representing the query file and name of the output file, respectively. Ex: 'python3 VSM.py query_list.txt output_file.txt'
